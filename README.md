# xyz-reader (includes in Udacity Nanodergree)
The fourth project for Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

In this project, I transformed the user experience of a news reading app using Material Design principles. This includes consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion and surfaces.

##What Have I Done?

I have learnt following things:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
